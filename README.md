# reddit-video-downloader
A simple python app with a GUI to download reddit videos on Linux (never tested on Windows, might work)

If there is already an URL in the clipboard it will use it, try to download the reddit video and open the folder that contains the output video. It will bypass the GUI.

Else : it starts the gui and you can download whatever you want from reddit.

It requires tkinter and clipboard.
